How to build and run the GeoHash project:
Class GeoHash includes a public method called "Sample". It will show a hard coded variation of the geohashing algorithm. The "main" function will create an instance of the GeoHash class and will run the sample.
The test project includes several test cases that iterate through different variations of getting dynamic geohashing values, encoding both into a string as well as a 32 bit integer.
